My project is not working properly. I am not sure where I have messed up within this lab, but I suspect it may have been around step 26 of part 4. I entered in the name api as instructed but it then started 
to give me an error code which I have screenshotted and submited along with this link to my Github. 

I struggled alot with this lab because some directions were unclear or I didn't read the directions fully. I also have never used GetHub before this class and alot of the directions
make it seem like you know how to use it. Nothing against you the professor, those are just part of my struggles. Another issue with the lab was that the opening the web browser to 127.0.0.1:3000 did not work for me 
either (another screenshot has been included). To which after that the URL provided by Vercel is not there and I cant see my code rendering properly. 

I will be 100% honest my falure to get this project done on time and correct is my own doing. I am extremely stressed out and miss manage my time, and I have myself to blame for this project not working. I hope you
can still see what is working (if this does) and give me a grade based on that. I will try to do better to ask questions sooner rather than later, and work to get things done on time. Please let me know if 
there is anything I missed and maybe why my project started to fall apart. 

Thank you for your time!
